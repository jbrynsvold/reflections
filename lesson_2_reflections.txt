What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file, which will allow you to see a list of commits in the repository later, among other things.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows what will be commited when a commit is run.

A working directory is just the directory in which you are currently doing things.

The repository is the directory that includes a .git directory? That .git directory has a bunch of meta data in it, tracking changes.
