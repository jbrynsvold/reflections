When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a team or when you want to work on your project and you don't have your home computer with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may only want to update the remote repository every once in a while, because it is for bigger changes. The local one can have more small changes that people don't have to see.
